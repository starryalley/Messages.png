This is a [Garmin Connect IQ](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/) watch app, which displays your phone's notifications (selectable from which apps) as a 1-bit monochrome image.

This enables the user to read notifications in any language which is not possible on some garmin devices.

This project is the watch app.

## Overview

This is the watch app. You'll need a companion phone app for this to run correctly. Currently only supports Android.
See [Android Companion App](https://github.com/starryalley/Messages.png_Android)

## Functions

When watchapp starts, it pulls current unread notifications from phone, and displays a scrollable notification overview consisting of just 1 line.

User can then select each notification and enters detail view, where full text is viewable there.

## Status

Currently only tested on Fenix 6 Pro and Vivoactive 4s.
